# Compilation and Execution Instructions

## Overview

This document provides instructions for compiling and running the individual C programs as well as the shell script designed to execute them.

## Compiling the Programs

Before running the programs, you need to compile them. Use the following commands in your terminal:

1. **Compile the Riemann Program**:
   ```bash
   gcc -o riemann riemann.c -lm
   ```

2. **Compile the OpenMP Riemann Program**:
   ```bash
   gcc -o riemann_omp riemann_omp.c -fopenmp -lm
   ```

3. **Compile the MPI Riemann Program**:
   ```bash
   mpicc -o riemann_mpi riemann_mpi.c -lm
   ```

## Running the Programs

Once compiled, you can run each program individually as follows:

1. **Run the Non-MPI Riemann Program**:
   ```bash
   ./riemann <param_a> <param_b>
   ```
   For example:
   ```bash
   ./riemann 2 10
   ```

2. **Run the OpenMP Riemann Program**:
   ```bash
   ./riemann_omp <param_a> <param_b> <num_threads>
   ```
   For example:
   ```bash
   ./riemann_omp 2 10 4
   ```

3. **Run the MPI Riemann Program**:
   ```bash
   mpirun -np <num_processes> ./riemann_mpi <param_a> <param_b>
   ```
   For example:
   ```bash
   mpirun -np 4 ./riemann_mpi 2 10
   ```

## Using the Shell Script

To compile and run all programs simultaneously, you can use the provided shell script:

1. **Make the script executable**:
   ```bash
   chmod +x exec_time.sh
   ```

2. **Run the script with the required parameters**:
   ```bash
   ./exec_time.sh <param_a> <param_b> <num_threads>
   ```
   For example:
   ```bash
   ./exec_time.sh 2 10 4
   ```

## Output

- Each program will print the approximation of the integral along with the execution time.
- The shell script will log the execution times in a file named `execution_times.csv`.

## Disclaimer

For detailed results of the integrals, run each program separately as they provide comprehensive output specific to the integral calculations.
